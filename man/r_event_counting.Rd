\title{Generates random samples of event counts}
\usage{
r_event_counting(n, mu, lambda, stream_length, F_event, F_interim,
  equilibrium = TRUE, p0 = 0, tuning = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of behavior streams to generate}

\item{mu}{mean event duration}

\item{lambda}{mean interim time}

\item{stream_length}{length of behavior stream}

\item{F_event}{distribution of event durations. Must be of class \code{\link{eq_dist}}.}

\item{F_interim}{distribution of interim times. Must be of class \code{\link{eq_dist}}.}

\item{equilibrium}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, then equilibrium initial conditions are used; 
if \code{FALSE}, then \code{p0} is used to determine initial state and normal generating 
distributions are used for event durations and interim times.}

\item{p0}{Initial state probability. Only used if \code{equilibrium = FALSE}, in which case
default is zero (i.e., behavior stream always starts with an interim time).}

\item{tuning}{controls the size of the chunk of random event durations and interim times.
Adjusting this may be useful in order to speed computation time .}
}
\value{
A vector of behavior counts of length \code{n}.
}
\description{
Random generation of behavior streams (based on an alternating
renewal process) of a specified length and with specified mean event 
durations, mean interim times, event distribution, and interim distribution,
summarized as the the total number of behaviors that began during the recording
session
}
\details{
Generates behavior streams by repeatedly drawing random event durations and 
random interim times from the distributions as specified, until the sum of the durations and interim
times exceeds the requested stream length. Then applies an event counting filter to the generated behavior streams.
}
\examples{

r_event_counting(n = 5, mu = 2, lambda = 4, stream_length = 20,
                     F_event = F_exp(), F_interim = F_exp())
