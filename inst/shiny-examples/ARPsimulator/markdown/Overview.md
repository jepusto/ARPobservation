### Simulating direct observation procedures for single-case studies

A common problem when designing a single-case study is determining how to measure the target outcome. For measuring a behavior through direct observation, you might need to answer the following questions:

* What recording system should I use?
* For interval recording systems, how long should the intervals be?
* How long do I need to observe during each session?
* How many sessions will I need to achieve stability in each phase?

The ARPsimulator is a tool for helping you make more principled decisions about these questions, by experimenting and testing out different measurement strategies before going out to collect data on real live behaviors. It works by simulating behavioral observation data using a realistic model and creating a graph containing hypothetical study results. (This sort of planning exercise is similar in some ways to conducting a power analysis for a between-subjects experiment.)

In order to use the tool, you'll need to make some initial guesses about the characteristics of the behavior and how it might change in response to treatment. You'll also need to know what type of study you plan to conduct (i.e., a multiple baseline design or a treatment reversal design). The remainder of this guide will explain how to access the tool and then walk you through how to use it.
