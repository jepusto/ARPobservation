### Behavioral parameters

In order to make effective use of the ARPsimulator, you will have to have some idea about the characteristics of the behavior you are trying to measure. The simulator provides models for two different types of behaviors, called event behaviors and state behaviors:

* __Event behaviors__ (also known as frequency behaviors) are those where each occurrence is instantaneous (at least approximately), and where the main characteristic of interest is the __frequency__ or __rate__ of occurrence. For example, a child's self-injurious behavior might involve head-smacking, and the researcher would interested in measuring (and ultimately, reducing) the rate of head-smacks.
* __State behaviors__ (also known as duration behaviors) are those where each occurrence (spell, bout,...) of the behavior lasts some length of time. For example, a student's on-task behavior involves lengths of time where he is on-task and lengths of time where he is off-task, day-dreaming, or engaging in problem behavior. With state behaviors, the researcher is often most interested in measuring (and changing) the __prevalence__ or __percentage duration__ of the behavior, although they may also be interested in the behavior's __frequency__ or __rate of occurrence__ (e.g., one might want to encourage _long_ bouts of on-task behavior, rather than many short bouts, even if the overall percentage duration is the same). 

To use the tool, you will first need to choose which type of behavior to simulate. (Usually this shouldn't be to hard to decide.) The further choices you will need to make are contingent on the type of behavior you want to simulate. Select the appropriate option from the first drop-down menu in column 1 of the simulator. Then read further about the inputs for event behaviors or for state behaviors.
