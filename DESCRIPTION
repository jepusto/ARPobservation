Package: ARPobservation
Title: Tools for simulating different methods of observing alternating renewal
    processes
Description: ARPobservation provides a set of tools for simulating data based
    on direct observation of behavior. It works by first simulating a behavior
    stream based on an alternating renewal process, based on specified
    distributions of event durations and interim times. Different procedures for
    recording data can then be applied to the simulated behavior stream.
    Functions are provided for the following recording methods: continuous
    duration recording, event counting, momentary time sampling, partial
    interval recording, and whole interval recording.
