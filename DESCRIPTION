Title: Tools for simulating direct behavioral observation recording procedures based on
    alternating renewal processes
Description: ARPobservation provides a set of tools for simulating data generated 
    by direct observation recording. It works by first simulating a behavior
    stream based on an alternating renewal process, given specified
    distributions of event durations and interim times. Different procedures for
    recording data can then be applied to the simulated behavior streams.
    Functions are provided for the following recording methods: continuous
    duration recording, event counting, momentary time sampling, partial
    interval recording, and whole interval recording.
